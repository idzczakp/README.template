# README.template

A personal template for `README.md` files for code projects.

## Usage
Copy the [example file](EXAMPLE.README.md) `EXAMPLE.README.md` to a new project, rename it to `README.md` and start filling in, editing and removing headlines & sections (not all will be applicable to every project.)

If you want to include the template as-is in your own project (i.e. _as template file_), you are very welcome to do so. Just mention the Creative Commons licence, attribute me and link back to this repository like I did above (you can just copy and paste the source code from the [example](EXAMPLE.README.md) file or this readme) and include the full licence text, see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

If you get personal use out of the template, please give credit as well. Your README will likely not be recognisable as having been based on my template anymore once you edit it to your needs – it is, after all, just a simple Markdown file – but it would be the nice (and right) thing to do and help spread the word. Other people might find knowing about this file useful too, after all. (: Leaving the bit that says "This README was created using..." at the bottom of `EXAMPLE.README.md` intact will suffice!
