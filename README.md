# README.template

A personal template for `README.md` files for code projects.

## Usage
Copy the [example file](EXAMPLE.README.md) `EXAMPLE.README.md` to a new project, rename it to `README.md` and start filling in, editing and removing headlines & sections (not all will be applicable to every project.)

## Licence
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons Licence" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png" /></a><br /><span xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"><span rel="dct:type" href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text"><a property="dct:title" rel="cc:attributionURL" href="https://github.com/keikoro/README.template">README.template</a> by <span property="cc:attributionName">K Kollmann</span> is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.</span>

If you want to include the template as-is (i.e. _as template file_) in your own project, you are free to do so as long as you mention the licence, attribute me and link back to this repository. The source code for this licensing information – as displayed above or seen toward the end of `EXAMPLE.README.md` – is:

```
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons Licence" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png" /></a><br />
<span xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"><span rel="dct:type" href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text"><a property="dct:title" rel="cc:attributionURL" href="https://github.com/keikoro/README.template">README.template</a> by <span property="cc:attributionName">K Kollmann</span> is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a>.</span>
```

If you get personal use out of the template, please give credit as well. Your README will likely not be recognisable as having been based on my template anymore once you edit it to your needs – it is, after all, just a simple Markdown file – but it would be the nice (and right) thing to do and help spread the word. Other people might find knowing about this file useful too, after all. (:

Just leave the bit that says "This README was created using..." at the bottom of `EXAMPLE.README.md` intact or (re-)add it manually using:

```
